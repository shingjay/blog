Hello there, thanks for stumbling onto my personal page! I'm a software engineer working at Expedia. I am currently in the midst of pursuing the next stage of my fledgling career.

Some of the other things that interest me involve soccer, hiking, boxing, traveling, photography, cooking and scuba diving.
