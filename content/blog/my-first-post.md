This is my first blog post on a content publishing engine. I've been dawdling about using Jeykll for starting up a personal blog, but have never invested enough time into doing it. One day, I stumbled upon a Hugo-built site on Hacker News, and decided to finally jump the gun to doing it. I found Hugo significantly easier to use and set up; I managed to get this up and running in under an hour. I didn't want to use something overly complicated for publishing a blog.

### Theme
I picked up the Cocoa theme as I thought it was simple, clean and concise. I was looking for something very unassuming and this seems to do the job.

### Deployment
https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/ Deployment was simple! It was the matter of following the steps listed in Hugo documentation and in no time I had something going on.

### DNS
I purchased shingjay.com through Google Domains many years ago, but never actually got to take advantage of it. This is me finally putting it to good use!

### Markdown
TBH, I've never really used Markdown before (I'm pretty embarrassed by this). After setting up the blog, I took some time to figure out the Markdown syntax; and found [this Github page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to be a handy Markdown reference point. I realized that I've been used to using Atlassian's Confluence Mark up language during my 9-5 jobs, and this would help for any formatting troubles :)
