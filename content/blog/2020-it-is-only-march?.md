It's only March in 2020 but it felt like the year has gone by already.

A few major things have happened in the past 3 months, namely:
    1. My manager of 2 years decided to step down
    2. Expedia decided to lay off 12% of its employees; my immediate colleague got canned
    3. COVID-19 affecting me both personally and professionally; my day-to-day schedule has been upended and travel plans canceled. Expedia as a whole isn't doing well and I suspect that there'll be another round of layoffs in the near future. Besides that, I've never been productive while working from home.

The combination of these factors have definitely increased stress levels and have given me a lot of anxiety - cue the long sleepless nights. This in turn causes me to not be productive at work in general - I'm just not motivated enough.

After several weeks of languishing in this situation, I decided that I needed to get out of this downwards spiral of negativity and had to do something about it. A few things seemed to do the trick:
    1. Meditation - this seems awfully cliche-ish, but I found that it helped me tremendously. I got started with the Headspace app (basic meditation courses are free) and even a 5 minute session helped cleared the mind. That helped calm me down and reduced my anxiety significantly.
    2. Exercise - people close to me know that I take my boxing regiment very seriously. With the gym being closed, I had to make sure I kept up with working out and not be complacent. I came up with my own workout sessions and constantly went out for jogs whenever I was stuck at solving a problem at work (I suppose this is a perk of working from home).
    3. Differentiating between what's in my control vs what's not - this helped me move my focus away from things I cannot control (things like how fast the virus spreads, on whether there'll be more layoffs in the future or the stock market teetering into the brink) and towards things I can control (keep performing at work, reduce expenditures, preparing for interviews).
    4. Keeping in touch with people I regularly interact with - instead of hanging out with my friends physically, we started playing games together. Someone in my team came up with the idea of doing virtual coffee chats, which helps keeping in touch with the colleagues.
    5. Deal with remote working - I'll write a separate blog post about this eventually as I figure things out. I realize that working remotely has it's benefits but there are some quirks to it as well. One thing I've noticed that worked well was having that separation between work 'space' and home 'space'. I have to set up a space at home that's specifically for work only and not treat it as 'home'.
